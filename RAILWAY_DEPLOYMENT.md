# Railway Deployment Guide

## Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Prerequisites
- Railway account (sign up at https://railway.app)
- GitHub repository connected to Railway
- Required environment variables ready

### 2. Required Environment Variables

Set these in your Railway project settings:

```bash
# Required
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here

# Optional (for email notifications)
EMAIL_SENDER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password_here
EMAIL_RECEIVER=admin@example.com
```

### 3. Deploy to Railway

1. **Connect Repository**
   - Go to Railway dashboard
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose your repository

2. **Configure Service**
   - Railway will automatically detect the Dockerfile
   - Set environment variables in the "Variables" tab
   - Save changes

3. **Deploy**
   - Railway will automatically build and deploy
   - Monitor the deployment logs
   - Once deployed, access your service at the provided URL

### 4. Add PostgreSQL Database (Recommended)

For production use, add a PostgreSQL database:

1. In your Railway project, click "New"
2. Select "Database" â†’ "PostgreSQL"
3. Railway will automatically set `DATABASE_URL` variable
4. Restart your service to apply the new database

### 5. Verify Deployment

After deployment, verify these endpoints:

- **Healthcheck**: `https://your-app.railway.app/healthcheck`
  - Should return: `{"status": "healthy", "timestamp": "...", "service": "chatbot-backend"}`

- **Homepage**: `https://your-app.railway.app/`
  - Should display the chatbot interface

- **Admin Panel**: `https://your-app.railway.app/admin`
  - Requires authentication with ADMIN_USERNAME and ADMIN_PASSWORD

## Troubleshooting

### Service Not Starting
- Check Railway logs for errors
- Verify all required environment variables are set
- Ensure GROQ_API_KEY is valid

### Healthcheck Failing
- Railway healthcheck endpoint: `/healthcheck`
- This endpoint is public (no authentication required)
- Should respond with 200 status code

### Database Errors
- If using SQLite (default): ensure `/tmp` directory is writable
- For production: use Railway PostgreSQL database
- Check DATABASE_URL is properly formatted

### Model Loading Issues
- The app will download models on first start
- This may take a few minutes
- Check logs for "Loaded FAISS with X docs" message

- `Dockerfile` - Defines the container image
